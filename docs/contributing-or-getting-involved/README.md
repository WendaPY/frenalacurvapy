# Contributing \| Getting Involved

## **Required reading: Code Of Conduct**

We love having you here. But before you start, to ensure everyone has a good experience, we ask **everyone** that interacts with our community and staff to read our code of conduct.

{% page-ref page="../code-of-conduct/" %}

## **Ways of contributing**

There are many ways to get involved with Ushahidi, and some of them are great for first time contributors. If you never contributed to Open Source Software before, or need more guidance doing it, please join the community in one of the channels listed [here](../get-in-touch.md).

### üìù **I am interested in writing documentation**

**I**f you find an area of the Ushahidi platform that could use better docs, we would love to hear from you in an [issue](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues/new/choose), and would be seriously excited if you send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/compare). **This is a great way to get involved,** and one of the highest impact changes you can make at the moment. You can choose to work on user documentation, fix typos, or add new sections for discussion and collaboration with the community. Every little bit helps.

### üêõ I found a bug and want to r**eport it**

If you found an issue/bug, please report it [here](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues). Someone on the team will jump in to check it, try to help, and prioritize it for future development depending on the issue type.
