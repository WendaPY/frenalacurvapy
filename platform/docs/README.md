## What is Ushahidi?

Ushahidi is an open source web application for information collection, visualization and interactive mapping. It helps you to collect info from: SMS, Twitter, RSS feeds, Email. It helps you to process that information, categorize it, geo-locate it and publish it on a map.

## Required reading: Code of Conduct.

We love having you here. To ensure everyone has a good experience, we ask **everyone** that interacts with our community and staff to read our code of conduct.
