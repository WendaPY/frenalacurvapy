# Encouraging contribution from non-developers

At Ushahidi we create products that are beneficial to many different organisations across the globe, from large non-profits to grassroots we want our products to be accessible to, and informed by the people that use them.

This project was part of Mozilla Open leader 6 and an initiative on how to include community development workers, international development workers, activists and volunteers as an integral part of the contribution process and can see how their experiences and input can improve our tools that will help them with their causes.

We found that often, these people don't code, but want to contribute in their knowledge and experiences. They have a deep understanding of what tools need to do in order to make a positive change in the work that they do.

We're currently still developing the process in which these community development workers, international development workers, activists and volunteers can contribute. You can view the repo for [Idontcode-at-Ushahidi](https://github.com/ushahidi/Idontcode-at-Ushahidi), access the [read me](https://github.com/Erioldoesdesign/Idontcode-at-Ushahidi/blob/master/README.md) to understand on how you can become involved in this initiative in it's early stages. Alternatively, you can contact the Ushahidi team through the [Get in Touch](https://ushahidi.gitbook.io/platform-developer-documentation/contributing-or-getting-involved/get-in-touch) section of these docs.
