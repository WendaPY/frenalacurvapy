# Synthesis example 2

## Subject 1 - HDX Export Prototype Test Notes

**Test Date:** 20th April 2018

**User:** General user, works as a web designer, relatively new to the platform.

**Task 1:** Previous experience with ‘tagging’ \(no screen required\)

**Scenarios:**

1. Ask the users to describe what they think when they here the term ‘tagging’ or ‘labelling’ means in relation to websites, digital products, software etc.
2. Ask users when they have previously had experience of ‘tagging’. What was the nature of the content? Was there any extraction of data afterwards? Whether there was anything they wish they could have done that they couldn’t do.

The prototype \(URL\) opens on Settings view.

**Scenarios:**

1. Can you show me where you’d look to download CSV spreadsheet files?
2. \(On Export page with 3 CTAs\) Without clicking, can you explain to me what options you think are available from here?
3. What would you need to do in order to feel comfortable choosing one of the three buttons?
4. Can you tell me what you expect ‘hxl tags or attributes’ to be? Don’t worry if you don’t know, we’re looking for your best guess if you’ve never heard of them before.
5. If you haven’t already, click a blue, underlined link.
6. Were you expecting a page like this? If not how does it differ from your expectations?
7. Spend a minute or so reading the information here. \[Pause\] Can you give me a summary of your understanding of hxl tags. \(There are no wrong answers!\)
8. How would you get back to where you were?
9. If you haven't already, please click the back button \(you may need to click a few times on a ‘real’ website.
10. Imagine you want your volunteer data to include hxl tags. 

\(We can briefly explain here that hxl tags are a way of ‘assigning’ a ‘term’ to a piece of information. Use Justin’s analogy of Instagram/Twitter hashtags!\)

Which option would you choose? \(they can click at this point\)

1. As you choose this option, what are you thinking? What is your first impression of this page? \(Should be on the first view of the export table\)

</table>**Scenarios:**

1. Is it clear how you progress? What are the steps you would take to start this section?
2. Can you show me how you would know if a certain section was going to be included in the eventual CSV download?
3. Can you show me how you would add a HXL tag?
4. \(If they click on the ‘Leave empty’ drop down\) What do you think of the options presented in this drop-down list? What kinds of information does it give you?
5. Can you add the hxl tag ‘activity’
6. Can you show me \(without clicking\) how you might add a hxl attribute?
7. \(If they click on the ‘Leave empty’ attribute drop down\) What do you think of the options presented in this section? What kinds of information does it give you in relation to the tags? 

\(Is the difference between tags and attributes clearer for the user at this point?\)

1. Can you now show me how you would add a custom hxl attribute? \(Encourage clicking now\)
2. \(on the ‘please type an attribute’ field\) What do you expect to be able to do here? \(Go through the clicks in order to add the custom attribute\)
3. Has any information changed? Can you explain what you are seeing/understand?
4. Can you now add a tag to ‘description’. Can you point to a tag you might choose if you wanted to capture information relating to a ‘flyer’ \(like a handout/leaflet/pamphlet\) There are no wrong answers!
5. \(If they haven’t already\) Please click ‘item’ and then add a custom attribute for ‘flyer’.
6. Can you show me how you would add a second attribute? \(Once user find blue link\) Can you now add the attribute ‘adults’
7. Take a moment to pause, Can you describe your current thoughts on the process? Anything that has stood out to you?
8. Please continue with the section ‘Location’ and add a tag ‘geo’
9. \(Pause - see if they notice the list is less populated\) Why do you think this list has less options?

Q: \(if they don’t notice\) Is there anything you notice about the drop down list? Why do you think this list has less options?

1. Can you now add two hxl attributes ‘longitude’ and ‘latitude’. \(these are the last tags/attributes to add during the test the ‘export to CSV and HDX buttons should be clickable\)
2. Take a moment to pause, Can you take a look at this screen and explain what you have just completed.

   Can you point out the HXL tags and attributes?

   Do you remember what they mean? If not can you give a good guess?

3. Can you now show me how you would get a CSV file? What would you expect to see happen next?
4. Can you tell me what you think ‘Export to HDX’ means? \(Do people assume this is a file extension type? Do they understand it’s a whole system?\) Go ahead and click ‘Export to HDX’. Take me through your impressions of this message.

</table>1. Any final thoughts?

UI was easy and familiar.

User wanted more normal dialog that guide them along the process and reassures.

User would have spent much more time reading through all the documentation but expressed a desire for a ‘condensed’ version or a ‘tutorial’

User didn’t understand the term ‘deployment’

User wants a progress bar in certain areas.

Wants more illustrations or diagrams to help them along like a clock when the ‘export’ is happening.
